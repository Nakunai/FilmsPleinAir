A project that I made in 2017 as part of my training. (2nd project)

The newly created association ‚ÄúLes Films de Plein Air‚Äù has just obtained authorization to
screen films at Parc Monceau in Paris this year, from August 5 to 8 each evening,
from 6 p.m. to midnight.
Wanting to introduce art-house films to as many people as possible, the creation of a website
proves almost essential for the distribution and communication of its festival.
The online pre-registration system will allow the association to estimate the number
of people present during each broadcast
